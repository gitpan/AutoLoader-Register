Autoloader/Register version 0.01
================================

AutoLoader::Register is similar in functionality to what AutoSplit and 
SelfLoader can do. You include the module in your class and pass 
key/value pairs to its import method. Key being a method name and the value
either an anonymous subroutine or the stringification thereof.

Once one of these methods is called, it is compiled (if necessary) and 
mungled into your class so that further calls of this method wont trigger
the autoloader again.

It comes with a custom can() method since UNIVERSAL::can() generally can't 
report autoloaded methods. Apart from that you can specify what to do under
exceptional circumstances (that is, a non-existing method gets called).

Additionally, AutoLoader::Register allows to pull in arbitrary methods 
from other classes without the necessity to make your class a subclass.
